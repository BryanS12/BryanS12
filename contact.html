			<h1>My Medical Journey</h1>
		</header>
		<p>	A wild dream.</p>
		<p>	Growing up in Canada, things weren't always smooth - I shared one small bedroom with my brother,  was outcasted throughout my childhood for my skin, spent hours studying under a single dim reading light, and was bullied for my eczema-a skin condition that left the skin on my neck and joints horribly scarred.</p>
		<p>	I had one goal in my early life. I wanted to be doctor.  I am a current undergraduate student planning on going into the field of medicine. I am attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, majoring in biology. After getting my bachelors, I am going to medical school, to specialize in Dermatology.</p>
		<p>	The unfortunate reality of the current state of medicine is that becoming a doctor is that going to Medical school is prohibitively expensive. I have calculated that it will cost upwards of 208,940 dollars for my four years in medical school. Any support would be greatly appreciated, and I cannot thank you enough! The funds will go specifically towards the tuition for medical school. </p>	
		<p>	If you would like to follow my journey towards becoming a doctor and learn more about me, check out my <a href="index.html">blog</a> and my <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/bryan-medical-school-journey?utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet">GoFundMe</a></p>
