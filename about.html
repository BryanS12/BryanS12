		<p>	Hi there! My name is Bryan and I'm a current undergraduate student planning on going into medicine. I am currently studying at the University of California, Santa Barbara, majoring in biology. I plan on getting my bachelors in 4 years, then attending Medical School, specializing in Emergency Medicine or Dermatology. I hope to serve my community, as well as pursuing international medical missions, to help those abroad. 		</p>
		<p>	My interests in medicine started when I was young. I was born with a skin condition called Atopic Dermatitis (eczema), which resulted in rough dry and flaky skin patches around joints and other parts of my body. My skin would often be cracking, oozing, itch as if there were thousands of bugs crawling over me. As a child, I was often on the end of much bullying and jokes, where others would give me unpleasant names such as “Lizard Skin” or “Dragon Skin”. My eczema got worse as I entered middle school, with the most severe afflictions on my neck, a very noticeable area.		</p>
		<p>	However, I was exposed to my ray of hope, a dermatologist. With his help, I was slowly able to battle this condition. After a few years of treatment, most of the symptoms have disappeared. I no longer had to be self-conscious about my body. Before this experience, I have never had anyone aid me in such a way, helping me with a condition I would otherwise suffer from.</p>
		<p>	Fast forward to junior year of high school, I still had my goal as becoming a doctor. I decided to pursue medical related activities, so I would learn if this really was the field for me. However, I did not have much experience in the field of medicine. I volunteered at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, I worked the information desk at the hospital, guiding visitors to their destinations. I also helped patients get admitted into the hospital as well as helping families of patients find their loved ones. I also attended several Medical related camps, where I was able to learn more about specifics in the field. </p>
		<p>	Additionally, I shadowed Dr. Enoch Choi, MD, a General Practitioner at the East Valley Urgent Care. I observed cases of different afflictions, from foot bunions to amber colored ear infections. At the Urgent care, we would go room to room, case by case.  It was like problem solving, as we entered every new room, we encountered a new patient, with new problems. I enjoyed every moment of it, interacting with patients and helping relieve their symptoms. </p>
		<p>	 That summer, two profound things happened. The first being an encounter with a patient during my shadowing tenure.I remembered the scene clearly. A middle aged woman had come in complaining about the swollen side of her body. Upon closer inspection, it was much worse.</p>
		<p>	Despite the glare from the bright lights of the operating room on my face shield, the inflamed boil stuck out like a bulging balloon, ready to burst. The scalpel moved with surgical precision, piercing the side, as pus and blood mixed together on the gauze. I subdued my urge to squirm. The woman had suffered from boils caused by untreated diabetes. The doctor explained carefully to the woman that she must take her diabetes medicine, or the results would be fatal. We were shocked as she explained how she had lost her medical insurance, and could not pay for her required medicine. It hurt seeing someone first hand having to risk their life because they could not afford the treatment they needed. This gave me further inspiration along my medical journey, and I hope to be able to serve underserved and impoverished populations. </p>
		<p>	One of my main goals is to be able to give medical care to those who need it the most, and are unable to receive it due to financial circumstances. The second event happened on Sunday, July 28th, 2019, when the unthinkable happened. 4 dead, 17 wounded. The first in a line of mass shootings that month. The first that hit so close to home, in nearby Gilroy. At the time, I was volunteering at SCVMC, the hospital where a majority of the victims were sent. The following few days were chaotic, with the staff stretched, and the hospital crowded with victims families, news crews, and onlookers. I helped out as much as I could,  addressing patients, answering phones, and helping out the strained staff. I was able to help out the patients and community in that time of crisis. A month after the shooting, most of the patients recovered and were discharged. Through these experiences, I knew that I had to become a doctor.</p>
